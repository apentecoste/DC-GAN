# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks
Code to present an application of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks for a Medium Article

Article and code are meant for educationnal purposes and provide a hands-on application to someone that wants to discover GANs that has a basic understanding of Convolutionnal Neural Network.


Article: [article](https://www.google.com)

Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


The repository contains two application of DC-GAN:

1) Generation of digits imagesfrom MNIST dataset

2) Generation of car images from CIFAR10 dataset

![Generate Cars from Cifar10](images&gifs/cifar10_cars_epoch100.png?raw=true "Results after 100 epochs")

![Generate Cars from Cifar10](images&gifs/dcgan_cifar10_cars.gif?raw=true "200 epochs")


We recommend to use a GPU to run the models if you don't want the training to take forever
